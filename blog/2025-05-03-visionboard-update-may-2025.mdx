📌 **Milestone:** [v1.0.0 Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OpenPathfinder/projects/3)

We're excited to announce a major set of improvements bringing us significantly closer to the `v1.0.0` release of VisionBoard. This update strengthens the platform’s architecture, testing, and deployment—paving the way for new management and developer experience (DX) features.

## ✅ What's New

### 🔧 Web Server & Routing
- Replaced static file serving with a new **Express-based web server**.
- Added routes for REST API:
  - `/api/v1/__health`
  - `/api/v1/generate-reports`
 - Website routes: `/`, `/projects/:id`
- Built with graceful startup and robust shutdown logic.

### 🖥 Dynamic Website Rendering
- EJS templating with partials for consistent layout and DRY structure.
- Website routes now render **dynamic content** while maintaining support for **static report generation** (backward-compatible).

### ✅ End-to-End Testing
- Fully integrated **Playwright-based E2E tests** with PostgreSQL-seeded test data.
- CI-powered HTML reports and screenshots for visual regression tracking.
- `data-testid` attributes added to templates for selector stability.
- GitHub Actions integrated for test results.

### 🧪 Unit & Integration Tests
- HTTP route coverage (`/`, `/api/v1/__health`, `/projects/:id`) using Supertest.
- Tests for schema validation, internal link builders, and utility functions.

### 🔍 API Validation & Swagger
- Full request/response validation via OpenAPI.
- Swagger UI for easy API exploration.
- API middleware limited to `/api/*` routes—UI remains unaffected.

### 🛡 Secure, Health-Checked Containers
- Hardened Docker and Compose workflows (drop root privileges, health checks...)

### 🧹 Refactoring & Structure
- Introduced modular `src/reports/` structure for better testability and separation of concerns.
- Isolated static assets and route middleware from server entrypoint.

### 📦 Dependency Updates
- **Added:** `express@5`, `supertest`, `@playwright/test` and `swagger-endpoint-validator`
- **Removed:** `finalhandler`, `serve-index`

### 📁 New Directories
- `src/httpServer/`: Server setup, routing, middleware.
- `src/reports/templates/partials/`: EJS partials for shared layout.
- `src/schemas/`: JSON schema validation.
- `e2e/`: Playwright tests, setup/teardown scripts, CI workflows.
