We\'re thrilled to have you here. This blog will serve as a space to share project insights, tutorials, updates, and community spotlights. If you\u2019re new to OpenPathfinder, this post will give you an overview of what we\u2019re all about, including **VisionBoard**, **FortSphere**, and our project **History**. Plus, we\u2019ve included a special **demo video** below\u2014check it out!\\n\\n## What is OpenPathfinder?\\n\\nOpenPathfinder is a collaborative open source initiative that empowers developers and organizations to secure, monitor, and manage their projects efficiently. We are committed to building tools that:\\n\\n- **Simplify compliance** with security and operational standards.\\n- **Automate repetitive tasks**, freeing up time for maintaining projects.\\n- **Provide actionable insights** to maintain project health.\\n\\nTo get started, visit our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started). Whether you\u2019re an experienced developer or just exploring new technologies, you\u2019ll find everything you need to set up your environment and begin working with OpenPathfinder.\\n\\n## VisionBoard\\n\\n**[VisionBoard](/docs/visionBoard/)** is a CLI tool that can query and store information from external resources about your project and perform complex analysis against compliance rules, this helps organizations transform raw data into actionable insights. [Created to support the OpenJS Foundation projects](/docs/history), it simplifies the complex task of monitoring security and operational health. Here are a few highlights:\\n\\n- **Customizable [Checks](/docs/visionBoard/Checks) and [Checklists](/docs/visionBoard/checklists):** Automates compliance with security standards, such as [the OpenJS Security Compliance Guide](/docs/visionBoard/checklists#official-checklists). Offers flexibility to define checks tailored to your project needs.\\n- **Integration with tools:** Connects to [GitHub APIs](/docs/visionBoard/providers#github-api), [OSSF Scorecard](/docs/visionBoard/providers#ossf-scorecard), and other external sources to enrich and analyze data. This ensures up-to-date and comprehensive insights.\\n- **Intuitive dashboards:** Offers visual insights into the state of your projects, making it easier to identify trends, risks, and areas for improvement.\\n\\nBy focusing on **planning** and **clarity**, VisionBoard helps keep your entire team aligned and moving forward together.\\n\\n## FortSphere\\n\\n[FortSphere](/docs/fortSphere) is a community-driven, open source CLI tool crafted with love by maintainers for maintainers. It empowers you to secure and streamline your GitHub organizations and repositories, ensuring you\u2019re always in control. Here are some highlights:\\n\\n- **Your tokens and data stay local:** All operations are performed locally\u2014your sensitive information never leaves your machine.\\n- **No blind trust required:** As an open source project, you don\u2019t need to trust others\u2014just the transparent and collaborative efforts of its contributors.\\n- **Centralized policy management:** Apply security and operational [policies](/docs/fortSphere/policies) across all your GitHub organizations with one command.\\n- **Real-Time checks and updates:** Detect non-compliant configurations and resolve them automatically.\\n- **Customizable policies:** Choose from a suite of predefined policies or create your own.\\n\\nBy focusing on **transparency** and **modularity**, FortSphere empowers OSS Maintainers to improve the security posture for their projects easily.\\n\\n\\n## Watch the Demo\\n\\nIn this video, you\u2019ll see how seamlessly VisionBoard and fortSphere integrate and how OSS Maintainers can use checks and policies to detect and mitigate security flaws.\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe \\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gf3BcLS_dXw\\" \\n        title=\\"OpenPathfinder demo (visionBoard + fortSphere)\\" \\n        frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n        allowfullscreen>\\n    </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Explore our journey\\n\\nCurious how OpenPathfinder came to be? Our roots can be traced through the [History](/docs/history) page, where we highlight major milestones and the long journey that started in 2024 with the creation of the [Security Program Standards for the OpenJS Foundation](http://localhost:3000/docs/history#1-initiate-development-of-security-program-standards-for-openjs-projects-feb-2024)\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\nWe invite you to join the OpenPathfinder journey.
