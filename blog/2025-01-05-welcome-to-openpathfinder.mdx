## What is OpenPathfinder?

OpenPathfinder is a collaborative open source initiative that empowers developers and organizations to secure, monitor, and manage their projects efficiently. We are committed to building tools that:

- **Simplify compliance** with security and operational standards.
- **Automate repetitive tasks**, freeing up time for maintaining projects.
- **Provide actionable insights** to maintain project health.

To get started, visit our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started). Whether you’re an experienced developer or just exploring new technologies, you’ll find everything you need to set up your environment and begin working with OpenPathfinder.

## VisionBoard

**[VisionBoard](/docs/visionBoard/)** is a CLI tool that can query and store information from external resources about your project and perform complex analysis against compliance rules, this helps organizations transform raw data into actionable insights. [Created to support the OpenJS Foundation projects](/docs/history), it simplifies the complex task of monitoring security and operational health. Here are a few highlights:

- **Customizable [Checks](/docs/visionBoard/Checks) and [Checklists](/docs/visionBoard/checklists):** Automates compliance with security standards, such as [the OpenJS Security Compliance Guide](/docs/visionBoard/checklists#official-checklists). Offers flexibility to define checks tailored to your project needs.
- **Integration with tools:** Connects to [GitHub APIs](/docs/visionBoard/providers#github-api), [OSSF Scorecard](/docs/visionBoard/providers#ossf-scorecard), and other external sources to enrich and analyze data. This ensures up-to-date and comprehensive insights.
- **Intuitive dashboards:** Offers [visual insights](/docs/visionBoard/report-management) into the state of your projects, making it easier to identify trends, risks, and areas for improvement.

By focusing on **planning** and **clarity**, VisionBoard helps keep your entire team aligned around compliance and community expectations.

## FortSphere

[FortSphere](/docs/fortSphere) is a community-driven, open source CLI tool crafted with love by maintainers for maintainers. It empowers you to secure and streamline your GitHub organizations and repositories, ensuring you’re always in control. Here are some highlights:

- **Your tokens and data stay local:** All operations are performed locally—your sensitive information never leaves your machine.
- **No blind trust required:** As an open source project, you don’t need to trust others—just the transparent and collaborative efforts of its contributors.
- **Centralized policy management:** Apply security and operational [policies](/docs/fortSphere/policies) across all your GitHub organizations with one command.
- **Real-Time checks and updates:** Detect non-compliant configurations and resolve them automatically.
- **Customizable policies:** Choose from a suite of predefined policies or create your own.

By focusing on **transparency** and **modularity**, FortSphere empowers OSS Maintainers to improve the security posture for their projects easily.


## Watch the Demo

In this video, you’ll see how seamlessly VisionBoard and fortSphere integrate and how OSS Maintainers can use checks and policies to detect and mitigate security flaws.
