# VisionBoard Checklists

VisionBoard helps you navigate complex security and compliance requirements by offering customizable and comprehensive checklists. These checklists group related checks to streamline adherence to specific standards, such as the OpenJS Foundation's Security Compliance Guide (SCG). They also allow you to tailor priority levels and requirements to meet the unique needs of your projects.

By using checklists, you can:
- **Simplify Compliance**: Automatically align your projects with industry standards like OpenJS SCG v1.0.
- **Customize Priorities**: Overwrite the severity or priority of checks based on your organizational needs.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Standardize security and operational processes across all your repositories.

Most organizations find it beneficial to subscribe to these checklists, as they offer ready-to-use configurations tailored for different project lifecycles, such as incubating, active, or retiring projects.
